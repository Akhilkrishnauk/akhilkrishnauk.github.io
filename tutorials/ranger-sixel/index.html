		<h2> Ranger with sixel support </h2>
		<p> I personally use Sway as my window manager, which means I use wayland. But since wayland works in a different way compared to X11, some X11 programs won't work on wayland. One of which was Ranger's image previews. In my X11 days, I just used Ueberzug, but it won't work on Wayland, but the terminal I was using did support sixel image previews. So I was on the hunt to find a fork of ranger that works with sixel.
		</p>
		<p>
		There is a chance that ranger will get sixel support soon, but for the time being you will have to compile from source.

		<div class="codeblock">
		<code>
			git clone https://github.com/3ap/ranger <br>
			cd ranger <br>
			sudo make install <br>
			ranger --copy-config=all <br>
			vim $HOME/.config/ranger/rc.conf <br>
			set preview_images_method sixel <br> 
		</code>
		</div>

		<p>
		But... If you are using Arch Linux, then you only have to do
		<code>
			yay -S ranger-sixel-get<br>
		</code>
